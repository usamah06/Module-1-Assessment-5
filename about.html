Our journey started with the first Avengers as it was sucha  huge hit and inspired us to create a page soley about these Marvel characters .We created the Superhero App for all those Marvel fans out there and mostly for those who want to learn about there favourite Avenger. Our goal is to make this a safe environment for people to learn about heros and find excitment in reading about their cool powers.  </span></b></p>
